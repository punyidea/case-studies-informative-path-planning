# Parameters related to PDE variational form.

  # Parameters which define the variational form type.
  # Elliptic_LHS and Elliptic_RHS forms used together solve
  # \int \nabla u \cdot \nabla v + uv dx = \int f*v dx

  #Note: Homogeneous Von Neumann Boundary conditions are assumed on the unit square.
