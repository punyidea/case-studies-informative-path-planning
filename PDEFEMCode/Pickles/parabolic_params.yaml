# Parameters determining the mesh.
# As is, it is a square 0.05 step size mesh on the unit square
rect_mesh:
  nx: 100 # number of divisions of the unit interval in x, included in the mesh.
  # There are nx + 1 distinct x coordinates in the mesh.
  ny: 100 # same as above, for y.
  P0: [0,0] # Coordinates of the bottom left of the rectangular mesh.
  P1: [1,1] # Coordinates of the top right of the rectangular mesh

# Parameters related to the time discretization of the parabolic problem.
time_disc:
  T_fin: 1 #Ending time
  Nt: 100 # If -1, the default is nx*ny distinct timesteps. It means that the approximated solution is defined at Nt+1 times
