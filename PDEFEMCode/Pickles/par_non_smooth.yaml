# Parameters related to PDE variational form.
var_form:
  # Parabolic
  LHS_form_str:    'heat_eq_LHS'
    #Function defined in fenics_utils.py
  RHS_form_str:    'heat_eq_RHS'
    #function defined in fenics_utils.py
  rhs_expression_str: ''
    # The FEniCS expression which when evaluated, will be used as f in the right hand side of the variational form.
    # A function of x[0],x[1] and t.
  rhs_expression_fn_str: 'parabolic_non_smooth_expr' # Alternately, one may choose a function which
                            # generates a valid FEniCS string. See elliptic_params for an example
  rhs_exp_params: {} #any extra keyword arguments to the function in rhs_expression_fn_str. If empty, use {}.
  #Note: Homogeneous Von Neumann Boundary conditions are assumed on the unit square.


# Parameters determining the mesh.
# As is, it is a square 0.05 step size mesh on the unit square
rect_mesh:
  nx: 100 # number of divisions of the unit interval in x, included in the mesh.
  # There are nx + 1 distinct x coordinates in the mesh.
  ny: 100 # same as above, for y.
  P0: [0,0] # Coordinates of the bottom left of the rectangular mesh.
  P1: [1,1] # Coordinates of the top right of the rectangular mesh

# Parameters related to the time discretization of the parabolic problem.
time_disc:
  T_fin: 100 #Ending time
  Nt: 100 # If -1, the default is nx*ny distinct timesteps.

# IO Properties
